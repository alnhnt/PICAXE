# PICAXE Projects and Libraries
The PICAXE family of microcontrollers use BASIC as a very easy and fun way to achieve quite complex electronic projects.

This repository supports the recording of PICAXE related projects and information for showcasing and re-use. 

Hopefully, makers will find sufficient detail to understand or reproduce the work and then extend this to new projects.

## Description
High-Level folders contain a ``README.md`` file, like this one, and these files describe the folder contents. For example, when browsing the GitHub Code, the Projects folder has a project listing in its [README.md](./Projects/README.md) file and beneath this each project is held in a sub-folder.

The "basinc_Modules" folder is a library of PICAXE BASIC software modules that can be freely included in your programs.  This folder contains a [README.md](./basinc_Modules/README.md) file that lists and describes each module.

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started, without needing to understand GitHub, is to just download the files you want and then open the programs or modules in the PICAXE Editor.

The easiest way to use a ``.basinc`` module is to copy it the same folder as your program, and then use ``#include "ModuleFileName.basinc"`` in your program initialization steps.  The modules contain inline documentation to help with their use.

## Help and Feedback
If you have any problems then you could read the [PICAXE Manuals](https://picaxe.com/getting-started/picaxe-manuals/), start a [Discussion](https://github.com/alnhnt/PICAXE/discussions/new/choose) or log an [Issue](https://github.com/alnhnt/PICAXE/issues/new) in this repository, or contact the [PICAXE Forum](https://picaxeforum.co.uk/).
