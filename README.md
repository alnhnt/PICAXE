# PICAXE Projects and Software Library
The PICAXE family of microcontrollers use BASIC as a very easy and fun way to achieve quite complex electronic projects.

This repository is here to support the recording and re-use of PICAXE related work. 

The content aims to provide sufficient detail for makers to understand or reproduce the work and to support the re-use of ideas in new projects.

## Description
Each Project has its own folder and this contains at least the ``.bas`` program(s) used in the project and a ``README.md`` file for information about the project.

The Library contains PICAXE BASIC software modules that can be freely included in your programs.  The Library folder contains a [README.md](./Library/README.md) file that lists and describes these modules.

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started, without needing to understand GitHub, is to just download the files you want and then open the programs or modules in the PICAXE Editor.

The modules end with a ``.basinc`` file extension and the easiest way to use them is to copy them to the same folder as your program, and then use ``#include "ModuleFileName.basinc"`` in your program initialization steps.  The modules contain inline documentation for their use.

## Help and Feedback
