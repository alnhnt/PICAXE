Program Notes
=============
    *   The PICAXE 20X2 gets the time from a GPS board, the NEO-M8N.
    *   A MCP7940N RTC is programmed with the time.
    *   The RTC is programmed with an alarm that wakes the PICAXE from Sleep or Doze using a hardware interrupt.
    *   Depending on the time, the alarm is set to make a daily time update, or switch the lights on or off.
    *   The PICAXE operates in Doze mode to provide HPWM for a H-Bridge that creates AC for fairy lights.
    *   HPWM operates in half-bridge mode, providing complimentary outputs and a deadband preventing shoot-through current.
    *   Internal pull-ups were used for I2C lines, these are about 30k compared to 10k spec for I2C.
    *   The "Timed" input is connected to a jumper, so that simple power on-off operation is possible without any timing.
    

PWM Notes
=========
	* The PWM_PERIOD has a value of 0 to 255, which sets the cycle time. The time (500 ns to 2 ms) = (PWM_PERIOD + 1) * 4 / InternalResonator / PWMDIV.
	* The PWMDIV parameter provides an optional frequency divisor of 4, 16 or 64, but 64 is not available on the 20X2 chip.
	* The PWM cycle range is 500 ns to 2 ms (from 2 MHz with no PWMDIV and down to 488 Hz with "PWMDIV16").
	* To set the PWM frequency (1 / Cycle Time) use PWM_PERIOD = (2,000,000 / (F * PWMDIV)) - 1.
	* The PWM_DEADBAND parameter has a range of 0 to 127 to set the time when the outputs are in an overlapping inactive state to prevent potential short circuits in driver circuitry. PWMDIV does not affect the Deadband. 
	* A PWM_DEADBAND of 1 equates to 500 ns (time = 4 * PWM_DEADBAND / InternalResonator).
	* The PWM_Duty cycle is a 10 bit on time and has a max value of 4 * PWM_PERIOD, which is 100% active and should not be exceeded. For an equal positive/negative duty cycle use 2 * PWM_PERIOD - PWM_DEADBAND.
