# Project Listing

Here's a description of the projects in this library:

Module Name | Module Description
:--- | :--- 
[Buzz_Wire_Race](./Buzz_Wire_Race) | A buzz wire game using a PICAXE 20X2 and a DF Mini Player to provide timed laps, background music, crash sound effects, and a spoken leader board. If you want speech output, this project shows a method.
[Fairy Lights - Simple Experiment](./Fairy_Lights-Simple_Experiment)	| Voltage sag was seen on PICAXE GPIO under high current loads. This project delves deeper into technical understanding and shows an LED current limiting resistor isn't always required.
[Fairy Lights - Solar and Battery to USB](./Fairy_Lights-Solar_and_Battery_to_USB)	| Christmas fairy lights can consume several AA batteries over Winter, or be very dim and short lived if they're solar based. This project shows how these were converted to mains power with a USB charger and a PICAXE 08M2. As well as being brighter, the mains supply is about 1,000 times cheaper and less environmentally damaging than using AA batteries.
[Fairy Lights - With RTC and GPS time](./Fairy_Lights-With_RTC_and_GPS_time)	| This project uses a NEO-M8N GPS module to gain an accurate time for a PICAXE 20X2. There's also a MCP7940N RTC (Real Time Clock) for a hardware interrupt to wake the PICAXE from Sleep and Doze modes and control fairy lights. The project controls multiple LED strings.
[PSU with Emergency Battery Input](./PSU_with_Emergency_Battery_Input)	| This project includes some tools and techniques for working with electronics, including dual power supplying, stripboarding, box labelling, simple voltage monitoring with an LED, and current control of LEDs. So, hands up and apologies, it doesn't include a PICAXE but I thought it would have some relevance here.
